# ClusteringAlgorithms

Employs 3 unsupervised machine learning clustering algorithms to group data on student test grades and establish grade boundaries based on student performance.
1. Hierarchical Clustering (one-dimensional)
2. K-Means Clustering (one-dimensional)
3. K-Means Clustering (two-dimensional)

Uses pandas and NumPy to process data and aid in computation of centroids and clusters.
Illustrates cluster groups in both one- and two- dimensions through Matplotlib.
